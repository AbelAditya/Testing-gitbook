## 8. System Architecture (Updated)

The text2video platform will be built using a microservices architecture, with separate services for user management, content management, video generation, collaboration, and search and discovery. The platform will be deployed on a cloud infrastructure, such as AWS or Google Cloud, to ensure scalability and high availability.

The platform will utilize a relational database, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, to store user and content data. The video generation service will utilize text-to-speech technology and pre-defined video templates to generate videos based on user-provided textual prompts.

In addition to the core services, the platform will also include the following components:

* **Prompting Pipeline**: The platform will utilize a machine learning-based prompting pipeline to improve the quality of the generated videos over time. The pipeline will analyze user feedback and improve the text-to-video models accordingly.
* **Model Selection**: The platform will allow users to choose from a selection of open-source text-to-video models. Users will be able to choose the model that best fits their needs and preferences.

The platform will be accessible through a web interface and a mobile application, with support for both iOS and Android devices. The web interface will be built using modern web technologies, such as React or Angular, while the mobile application will be built using native technologies, such as Swift or Kotlin.
